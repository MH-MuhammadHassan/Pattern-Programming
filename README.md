# Dart-Patterns

This repository contains a collection of pattern-based programs written in Dart. These programs use nested loops to generate a variety of patterns, making them an excellent resource for understanding and practicing loops and conditional logic in Dart.

## **Features**
1. **Descending Star Pattern**
   - Outputs stars (`*`) in a descending order. Example:
     ```
     ***
     **
     *
     ```

2. **Ascending Numerical Pyramid**
   - Outputs numbers in an ascending format. Example:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     1 2 3
     ```

3. **Row-Wise Repeating Numbers**
   - Outputs rows where each number is repeated. Example:
     ```
     1 1 1
     2 2 2
     3 3 3
     ```

4. **Mixed Star and Dollar Pattern**
   - Combines stars (`*`) and dollar signs (`$`). Example:
     ```
     $
     * $
     * * $
     * * * $
     ```

5. **Diamond Star Pattern**
   - Generates a diamond-like pattern with stars (`*`). Example:
     ```
     *
     * *
     * * *
     * * * *
     * * *
     * *
     *
     ```

6. **Symmetrical Number Pyramid**
   - Outputs a pyramid with numbers that ascends and descends symmetrically. Example:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     1 2 3
     1 2 3 4
     1 2 3
     1 2
     1
     ```

## **Code Highlights**
- Uses **nested loops** for creating rows and columns.
- Demonstrates **conditional checks** for custom symbols.
- Uses **string multiplication** for repetitive patterns.

## **How to Run**
1. Install Dart on your system if not already installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MH-MuhammadHassan/Pattern-Programming.git
